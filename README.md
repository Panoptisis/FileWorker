FileWorker

About
----
FileMover is a simple Java program that runs a worker class. This worker class can pretty much
do anything it wants, but the original idea was to recursively scan a directory and work on the
files in some way.

So far I have used this program to re-organize the location of my music files and clean up some
undesirable IDv3 tags.
